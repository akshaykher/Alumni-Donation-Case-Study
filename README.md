Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. If administrators could determine the factors that influence increased donation among alumni’s, they might be able to implement policies that could lead to increased revenues. Research shows that students who are more satisfied with their contact with teachers are more likely to graduate. As a result, one might suspect that smaller class sizes and lower student-faculty ratios might leads to a higher percentage of satisfied graduates, which in turn might lead to increased alumni donations. ** I have taken a dataset containing information of 48 national universities (America’s Best Colleges, Year 2000 Edition) and studied how the different factors affect the alumni giving rate.**
